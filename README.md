### About Pokemon
Pokemon is an adventure rpg game where you go on a journey to catch small animal like species called pokemons (Short for pocket monsters).
They can be caught using something known as pokeballs, but you need to weaken them first by battling with them using your own pokemons or other 
stratergies. Occasionally, you may encounter Team Rocket in Wild whose sole aim is to steal pokemons. You need to participate in Ultimate 
Pokemon duelling competition which is the Indigo League, but for that, you need to prove your worth by defeating 8 Pokemon Gym Leaders situated in 
different parts of world. As your pokemon gets stronger and gain experience, it will learn new attacks and even evolve to a stronger pokemon.
It is just a terminal based game but it will surely keep you busy for long...
