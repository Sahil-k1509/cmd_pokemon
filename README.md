### About Actual Pokemon:
Pokemon is an adventure rpg game where you go on a journey to catch animal like species called pokemons (Short for pocket monsters).
They can be caught using something known as pokeballs, but you need to weaken them first by battling with them using your own pokemons or other
stratergies. Occasionally, you may encounter Team Rocket in Wild whose sole aim is to steal pokemons. You need to participate in Ultimate
Pokemon duelling competition which is the Indigo League, but for that, you need to prove your worth by defeating 8 Pokemon Gym Leaders situated in
different parts of world. As your pokemon gets stronger and gain experience, it will learn new attacks and even evolve to a stronger pokemon.
